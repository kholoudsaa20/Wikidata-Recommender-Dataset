# Wikidata-Recommender-Dataset

Wikidata is an open knowledge graph built by a global community
of volunteers. As it advances in scale, it faces substantial challenges around
editor engagement. These challenges are both in terms of attracting new editors
to keep up with the sheer amount of work, and in terms of retaining existing
editors. Experience from other online communities and peer-production systems,
including Wikipedia, suggests that personalised recommendations could help,
especially newcomers, who are sometimes unsure about to contribute best to an
ongoing effort. For this reason, in this paper, we propose a recommender system
for Wikidata items. The system uses a hybrid of content-based and collaborative
filtering techniques to learn to rank items for editors, using item features as well
as previous interactions between editors and items. To facilitate further research
in this space, we also create two benchmark datasets, a general-purpose one with
250,000 editors responsible for 19 million interactions with 8 million items, and
a second one focusing on the contributions of more than 11, 000 more active
editors. We perform an offline evaluation of the system on both datasets with
promising results.

The code and datasets hosted in this repo have been created for the the paper "Learning to Recommend Items to Wikidata Editors", submitted for publication at the 18th European Semantic Web Conference (ESWC 2021).
